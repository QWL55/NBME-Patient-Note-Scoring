# NBME-Patient-Note-Scoring

This repository is the implementation of our final project for CMSC 35100 Natural Language Processing at the University of Chicago. Using a collection of patient notes from Step 2 Clinical Skills examination data from National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), we train medical concept extractors that achieve satisfactory performance on mapping clinical concept features to word sequences expressed in clinical patient notes. Our best model achieves 0.928 F1 score on the validation set and 0.797 on the test set.
